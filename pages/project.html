                <h4>About miRNA</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miRNAs (microRNAs) are short single-stranded non-coding RNAs of 20-25 base pairs and have long been treated as “junk RNAs” with no physiological role. However, in the 1990s, Professors Ambros and Lefkan discovered that miRNAs are deeply involved in the regulation of gene expression, particularly in the post-transcriptional control of protein expression, for which they received the Nobel Prize in 2024. This groundbreaking discovery showed that miRNAs are not simply unwanted RNAs, but play important roles in signaling and homeostasis in living organisms, and revolutionized the foundations of conventional biology. This has expanded the field of molecular biology, which previously focused only on proteins and long RNAs, and opened a new perspective for understanding the precise regulation mechanisms of gene expression.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now widely recognized that miRNAs are ubiquitous in most eukaryotes and regulate various physiological processes such as cell development, division, differentiation, and apoptosis (cell death) through the process of post-transcriptional gene silencing. miRNA dysfunction includes cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, It is implicated in the onset and progression of multiple diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders, and research on new diagnostic and therapeutic methods targeting miRNAs is rapidly advancing.</p>

                <h4>miRNA and Cancer</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In cancer research, miRNAs have been the focus of much attention. miRNAs are broadly classified into two types, “cancer-promoting miRNAs” and “cancer-suppressing miRNAs,” which are involved in carcinogenesis and tumor suppression, and are deeply involved in the mechanisms of cancer progression and metastasis. It has been shown that certain miRNAs are overexpressed in cancer cells while other miRNAs are suppressed, which causes cancer cells to proliferate, invade, and metastasize. For example, cancer-promoting miRNAs such as miR-21 contribute significantly to the aggressive growth of cancer cells, and suppression of their expression is considered an important target in cancer therapy.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, changes in miRNA expression are expected to be a useful biomarker for early diagnosis of cancer. Analysis of miRNA profiles in blood and urine may enable early detection of cancer and monitoring of the risk of recurrence. The potential for such applications has led to active research into the development of non-invasive diagnostic techniques using miRNAs.</p>
                
                <h4>Importance of Unmodified miRNA</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several methods for using miRNAs for the early detection of cancer have been proposed and are being studied for practical application. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs are involved in life are extremely complex and have not yet been fully elucidated. In addition, miRNAs are very small and in minute quantities, and there are many RNases in the body that degrade miRNAs, so further innovations are needed to stably measure miRNAs.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among such unstable miRNAs, most of the current studies focus on blood miRNAs that are resistant to RNase.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, some functions of miRNAs in cancer have been elucidated, but these results have biased the research, as “the relationship between cancer and miRNAs that are resistant to RNase” is being studied instead of “the relationship between cancer and miRNAs themselves.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To truly advance research on the relationship between cancer and miRNAs, we focused on unmodified miRNAs that are not resistant to RNase. The study of unmodified miRNAs in vivo will be very meaningful in terms of their biological functions and the processes of their production and degradation, which have yet to be elucidated. In the course of their research, they will focus on miRNAs that show RNase resistance and the common characteristics of the cells that produce them, and they expect that this research will help establish completely new diagnostic devices and therapies in areas where current miRNA knowledge alone is insufficient.</p>

                <h4>"Nano Pill Bug"</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposed “Nano Pill Bug” is a machine designed to capture unmodified miRNAs and further protect them from RNase. DNAorigami is a machine designed to protect ssRNA from further RNase.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nano Pill Bug is a machine that focuses on the speed of miRNA capture and protection from RNase. We came up with the idea of using the bending stress of DNAorigami to capture the miRNAs like a mousetrap. We also named the machine “Nano Pill Bug” because of the way it curls up when it captures and protects the miRNAs, comparing it to a pill bug.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our proposed “Nano Pill Bug” is a molecular machine designed to efficiently capture unmodified miRNAs and protect them from RNase. Although DNA oligami has been developed in the past to protect ssRNA, DNA oligami technology that is also specialized for rapid capture of miRNAs is very limited. The “Nano Pill Bug” offers a new approach that combines both speed of capture and protection.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “Nano Pill Bug” has a “mousetrap” like structure that captures miRNAs by applying bending stress to the DNA oligami structure. This structure deforms itself to curl up when it comes into contact with the miRNA, effectively capturing and protecting the miRNA. Furthermore, the curling behavior after capture also plays a role in blocking RNase attacks from the outside. We named it “Nano Pill Bug” because its curling behavior, which plays the role of capturing and protecting miRNAs, resembles the curling behavior of a pill bug.</p>
