                <h4>About miRNA</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;miRNA (microRNA) is a short single-stranded non-coding RNA that was long considered to have no physiological function and was thought to be unnecessary. Professors Ambros and Levkan have discovered that miRNA regulates protein expression, playing a crucial role in the body, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in 2024.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This breakthrough had a significant impact on biology, which had previously focused on proteins and long-chain nucleic acids, and has contributed to the detailed understanding of various metabolic reactions and functions. It is now understood that miRNA exists in most eukaryotic organisms and regulates various physiological processes such as cell development, proliferation, differentiation, and death through post-transcriptional gene silencing.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among these, the research on cancer, a disease closely related to genes, has shown that miRNA plays a significant role. miRNA acts as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes and affects cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. For example, in cancer cells, certain miRNAs are overexpressed, while others are suppressed.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, based on the stability and function of miRNA, several medical applications are expected as a countermeasure against cancer:<br>
                    Diagnostic Markers: miRNA is present in body fluids such as blood and is used as a diagnostic marker for diseases like cancer and cardiovascular diseases.<br>
                    Therapeutic Targets: Research is underway to utilize miRNA's regulatory functions for treating cancer, neurological diseases, infections, and more.<br>
                    Drug Delivery: Techniques are being explored to deliver miRNA to target tissues to regulate specific gene expressions and achieve therapeutic effects.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neurological Diseases: Abnormal miRNA has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.<br>
                    Cardiovascular Diseases: miRNA affects the proliferation and death of cardiomyocytes and the formation of blood vessels, playing a role in the progression of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

                <h4>Importance of Unmodified miRNA</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several methods have been proposed for using miRNA in early cancer detection, and further research is being conducted toward practical application. However, the mechanisms involving miRNA in life are highly complex, and their full understanding has yet to be achieved. Moreover, as miRNA is very small and present in trace amounts, and given that RNases, which break down miRNA, are abundant in the body, further innovations are needed to measure miRNA stably.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current research is focusing on blood miRNA that exhibits resistance to such RNases. As a result, the research is not about the relationship between cancer and miRNA itself, but rather about the relationship between cancer and miRNA that is resistant to RNase, leading to bias in the research.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To truly advance research on the relationship between cancer and miRNA, we have focused on unmodified miRNA, which is not resistant to RNase.</p>

                <h4>Nano Pill Bug</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Nano Pill Bug" that we propose is a device designed to capture and protect unmodified miRNA. While DNA origami can be used to protect short-chain RNA, for the purpose of miRNA protection, the speed of capture is crucial. Therefore, we came up with the idea of using the bending energy of DNA origami to capture miRNA, much like a mouse trap.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Nano Pill Bug can not only capture and protect unmodified miRNA but also be used as a diagnostic device for various genetic diseases, such as cancer, on-site. Moreover, the idea of using bending stress energy for capture and protection can be adapted to different sizes, offering potential applications as components for various molecular robots.</p>
