            <h3>DESIGN</h3>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The "Nano Pill Bug" we are developing is a device focused on protecting unmodified miRNA from RNase. This device is inspired by pill bugs, and when it captures miRNA, it rolls up and protects it. <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This structure consists of two DNA origami sheets and several stopper DNAs that connect them. One sheet has a double-layered structure, which bends due to the difference in the number of base pairs, forming a tubular structure. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These bent sheets are held together by pre-arranged stopper DNAs, maintaining a flat structure by balancing the tension between them. When the stopper DNA is replaced by miRNA through strand displacement, the tension in each sheet is released, and the miRNA is enclosed inside the tubular structure. <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The functionality of this structure can be extended, and by applying it to small molecules such as DNA or proteins, various applications are expected.</p>

        <div id="simulation">
            <h3>SIMULATION</h3> 
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The design of the Nano Pill Bug was carried out entirely using caDNAno, and its structural simulations were performed using cando and oxDNA. Additionally, simulations of the strand displacement reaction and sequence design were carried out using NUPACK.</p>

                <h4>1. Design of the Rolled Sheet Structure</h4>
                    <h5>Determining the Sheet Size</h5>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In DNA origami, when the same scaffold strand is used, the volume of the resulting structure is approximately the same. Therefore, we selected and designed the optimal radius, width, and thickness for the Nano Pill Bug to function as a robot that protects miRNA from RNase.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to making the radius small to prevent RNase from entering the Nano Pill Bug, we designed it as a two-layer structure rather than a single layer to fill the gaps in the DNA origami. As a result, the structure has a radius of about 20 nm and a width of about 36 nm.</p>

                    <h5>Determining the Bending Frequency</h5>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The optimal structure for the Nano Pill Bug that we envisioned is one where "the sheet is rolled just slightly overlapping itself once." By adopting this structure, it becomes easier to connect the ends when joining two sheets together, and compared to a more tightly wound structure, it is believed that the flat structure is more likely to be maintained. Additionally, by rolling the sheet more than once, the ends overlap, preventing RNase from entering through those areas.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To achieve this structure, we added skips to the inner layer and inserts to the outer layer of the sheet, placing them at appropriate intervals, which allowed us to bend the sheet as desired. Furthermore, to overlap the ends, we varied the frequency of the skips and inserts, adjusting the degree of bending to ensure that the sheet spirals inward like a coil.</p>

                <h4>2. Design of the Two-Sheet Structure</h4>
                    <h5>Stacking the Two Sheets</h5>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When creating the two-sheet structure, we stacked the two sheets "back to back" to cancel out the bending stresses of each sheet. For each sheet, we extended certain staple strands to create single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that could be used to link the sheets together, which were then connected using ssDNA. The length and number of the ssDNA used for the connections were determined through oxDNA simulations.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of capturing miRNA, it would be ideal to minimize the length and number of the input DNA strands. However, if the strand length and number are insufficient, the two sheets will not connect properly, and the two-sheet structure will collapse. Based on the simulation results, we determined the sequence for the most stable two-sheet structure.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the exchange reaction that occurs when introducing the TargetDNA into the connecting parts, we simulated the reaction using NUPACK. As shown in the figure below, the addition of TargetDNA triggers a strand displacement reaction, causing the smileDNA to detach, and the TargetDNA hybridizes with hashikko1 and hashikko2. This shows that the two-sheet structure is resolved by the TargetDNA, and the sheets separate and roll up. Each separated sheet becomes a rolled-up sheet due to its own bending stress, protecting the TargetDNA.</p>

                    <h5>Dynamic Simulation of the Two-Sheet Structure</h5>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the experimental procedure for creating the two-sheet structure, we performed a dynamic simulation of annealing in stages. If we tried to anneal the two sheets all at once, they would likely roll up separately, hiding the connection points, and the two-sheet structure would not form. Therefore, we decided to perform a staged annealing process for the connection points and the other parts of the structure.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initially attached the two scaffolds by adding only the staple strands at the connection points, then progressively added the staples that form the sheet, starting from the shortest ones, to create the two-sheet structure.<br>
                          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*This simulation has not been performed.*</p>

                <h4>Improved protection from RNase</h4>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current model has a hole on the lateral side, which does not completely prevent Rnase entry. We are therefore considering placing cholesterol-modified staple chains on the sides of the sheet structure to fill the holes and prevent RNase entry. We are also thinking of reducing the radius by stacking the sheets more to make them more airtight.<br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we have not yet even simulated these ideas, we believe that they are effective means to make the Nano Pill Bug a more practical technology.</p>
