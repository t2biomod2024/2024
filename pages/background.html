        <h2><span class="fade-in-text">PROJECT</span><span class="hosoku">supplement</span></h2>
        <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p>First, our project's final goal is the early detection of cancer.In fact, abnormal miRNAs begin to be expressed early in the
            development of cancer, altering the expression pattern of miRNAs in the blood.
            Recently, technologies that can detect and distinguish 13 types of cancer by reading these expression patterns have emerged.
            However, Non-added miRNA are degraded by RNase.
            Therefore, the miRNA currently detected by the expression pattern tests are limited to those protected by proteins or lipids.
            <br>So, we focused on these Non-added miRNAs and thought that by analyzing their expression patterns, it might be possible to
            identify types of cancer that are currently difficult to distinguish, such as cervical cancer.
            Thus, we came up with a method to protect and extract these unprotected miRNAs, inspired by nature.
            In nature, there are many organisms that protect their bodies from predators by rolling up.
            We focused on one such organism, the pill bug, and thought of creating an RNA protection carrier using DNA origami, mimicking
            its structure. Therefore, we named the structure we aim to create in this project "Micro Pill Bug."</p>
